# Implementation-of-a-Simple-Key-Value-Store-using-NodeJS-and-Redis

A simple example of key-value store implementation in redis as a in-memory cache.
I built a server and two end-points - one with cache and other without cache to load a simple html page. To store cache I used a key-value store "redis".
